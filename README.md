# Web Accessibility Impact Calculator


## Overview
The Web Accessibility Impact Calculator is a tool designed to help businesses understand the potential revenue and traffic they could gain by making their websites accessible. Using country-specific disability statistics and real-world conversion improvement data, it provides insights into the business case for web accessibility.

You can read more about the [business case for web accessibility](https://purplebyte.io/blog/business-case-accessibility/) and why you should always make it part of your business strategy.

## Why This Matters
Many businesses view accessibility as merely a compliance requirement or an additional cost. However, the disability market represents:
- Over Â£274 billion in spending power in the UK
- $490 billion in disposable income in the US  
- â‚¬150 billion in the EU
- A$54 billion in Australia
- C$55 billion in Canada

By not having an accessible website, businesses are potentially excluding up to 20% of their market, depending on their location.

## How It Works

### Input Data
The calculator takes three key metrics:
1. Monthly Website Visitors
2. Average Order Value 
3. Current Conversion Rate

### Calculations
The tool then:
1. Applies country-specific disability statistics to estimate potential disabled visitors
2. Calculates potential revenue based on:
  - Current conversion rates
  - Appoximate Industry-standard accessibility improvement factor (15%)
  - Average order values

### Country-Specific Data
The calculator includes disability statistics for:
- United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
- United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸  
- European Union ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
- Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
- Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

## Calculation Methodology
Potential Monthly Traffic = Monthly Visitors Ã— Country-Specific Disability Percentage
Potential Yearly Traffic = Monthly Traffic Ã— 12

### Revenue Calculation
Current Revenue = Monthly Visitors Ã— Current Conversion Rate Ã— Average Order Value
Potential Revenue = Monthly Visitors Ã— (Current Conversion Rate Ã— 1.15) Ã— Average Order Value
Additional Revenue = Potential Revenue - Current Revenue
### Traffic Calculation

### Disability Categories
For each country, we consider people with the following:
- Blindness and low vision
- Deaf and Hard of Hearing
- Mobility 
- Cognitive
